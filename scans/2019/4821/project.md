This is a sample Gemeindescan. It contains project data which in the future will be managed in a content database similar to SmartUse. The files stored in this folder will be updated through DataFlows. The data may include:

- Markdown content such as this text
- Point data (CSV, GeoJSON)
- Vector data (GeoJSON, GeoPackage, Shapefile)
- Pixel data (PNG, JPEG, TIFF, GeoTIFF)

The project metadata is specified in a Frictionless Data schema, within a `datapackage.json` file in this folder, and also accessible (searchable, transformable..) through an API. The schema will be developed in accordance to the [Spatial Data Package](https://research.okfn.org/spatial-data-package-investigation/#point-datasets) standard.

Maps are currently rendered using [smartuse-gl](https://github.com/smartuse/smartuse-gl).
